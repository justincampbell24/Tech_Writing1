When I sit down to write, I usually try to write the majority of the paper in one sitting. I despise starting a paper so much that I end up putting the assignment off until it's crunch time. This means I write almost the whole thhing in one sitting and then spend the next several times working onit by revising and editing. Depending on my understanding of whatever I am writing about, I brainstorm and try to narrow down exactly what I will talk about before ever writing.
I might try to incorporate working on assignments a little everyday or every other day into my habits just to ease my workload when writing.I think this might actually help me in my writing. When I attempt to write I am usually distracted, so writing in a place of solitude free of distractions would also likely improve my writing.
One of my strentghs in writing is being able to knock out a paper during crunch time with little sleep, but the side effect is that I do not recover for a couple days.
