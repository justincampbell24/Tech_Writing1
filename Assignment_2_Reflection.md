# Assignment 2 Reflection

I learned how to navigate wordpress despite my early struggles. Once I figured it out I saw the usefulness of the site for building my own website. 

I am not sure I understand the importance of building a blog for my field of study, but building a website is useful knowledge for the future. 

A blog seems useful to someone who might be more into specialized farming as far as my area of study goes.
