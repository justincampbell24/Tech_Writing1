The experiences I have had in writing were usually pretty clear in the aspect of topic and format. However, the audience for the papers I have written has never been clear. For example, in my high school English courses, we wrote argumentative papers, persuasiive papers and some research papers, but we never told what audience would be reading those papers if they had been published. Then in Composition 1 the audience was never made clear.
