## Work Flow

When I write papers, I tend to do my research about the topic. After conducting research, I build an outline with my main points and the evidence I want to use to support my points. I, then, narrow down my points and evidence so to avoid being too broad in my argument. I follow this with an early rough draft paper. I work on my rough draft until I get it where I think the paper needs to be as far as quality goes. I try to have someone proofread my paper and give me some feedback. I finish by correcting my paper and writng the final draft.

## Order of Work
