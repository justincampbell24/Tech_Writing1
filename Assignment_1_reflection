Initially, I was a bit confused and frustrated when choosing my topic for the instructional document, but after some worthwhile dialogue i figured out a topic and audience that were suitable to write about. Formatting my document in a way that was easy to follow was a struggle for me. I did not want to be overly in depth but I wanted to be in depth enough to successfully get my instructions across to the audience. I decided to use my steps as headings and then go in depth on each step below the corresponding heading. Once my rough draft was close to completion I felt much better about the whole document. 
In the end I felt more confident about my document than I did at the beginning. Writing the document was nearly as difficult as I first expected it to be.
