# **Instructions to Riding a Horse**

### Justin Campbell

## Summary

The following instructions are to explain the process of catching, saddling, and riding a horse. The instructions will also cover how to behave around a horse as well as control it. 

## Introduction

Riding a horse is a process that is more than jumping on a horse and galloping away. Horse riding involves several different aspects that include catching the horse, cleaning the horse, saddling the horse, bridling the horse, and then finally getting on the horse and riding it. Properly following the sequence of events will keep the person riding the horse safe as well as keep the horse safe. Horses can be skittish, so it is always important that safety be kept in mind while handling a horse. 
### Tools Needed (jargon)
Bridle, Saddle (breast collar, front cinch, flank cinch, connection straps), CurryComb, brush, halter, lead rope, reins, a friend to help, saddle blanket, parts of a saddle, parts of a bridle.

## Step by Step Instructions
### 1. Catching the Horse
Catching the horse you are going to ride can be somewhat difficult depending on the horses attitude and personality. Having a bucket of grain is always helpful in attracting the horse close enough to catch. Once the horse comes close enough wrap the lead rope around the horses neck to give it the illusion it is caught, then put the halter on the horses head, and reattach the lead rope to the base of the halter. Lead the horse to where you will saddle it and tie the lead rope to something solid.
### 2. Cleaning the Horse
Horses like to roll around in the dirt, so they must be cleaned a little bit before saddling them. Take a currycomb and scrape off all the caked on dirt and mud. When combing the horses coat be sure to start from the neck and work your way back and down. Combing with the lay of the hair is important to prevent damage to the horses coat. Once you are done with combing, take a brush and repeat the process starting from the neck and working back and down. The brush is mainly for working the dust out of the coat.
### 3. Saddling the Horse
Properly attaching the saddle to the horse is the most important part of preparing to ride. A saddle incorrectly attached to a horse can move and slide around the horses body and cause harm to both you and the horse. When saddling a horse, work from the left side of the horse. First, place the saddle on the back of the horse making sure the pommel of the saddle sits on top of the horses withers (shoulders). Reach under the horse and grab the front cinch, pulling the cinch back to the left side where you attach it to the front rigging dee on the left side. Make sure that the front cinch is positioned right behind the front legs. The front cinch should tight enough to keep the saddle from sliding around. Next you pull the flank cinch across the underside of the horse and attach it to the buckle on the left side. The flank cinch does not need to be tight. The purpose of the flank cinch is to just keep the saddle from going over the horses head if there is a sudden stop. Now take the breast collar around the base of the neck at the breast of the horse and attach it to the front rigging dee. Then take the connection strap attached to the breast collar and attach it to the front cinch between the front legs. Go back through all the straps and checks the tightness of each from beginning to end to make sure everything is correctly set up.
### 4. Bridling the Horse
The different parts of the bridle are as follows: bit, chinstrap, browband, headpiece, noseband, and cheekstraps. Getting the bridle on the horses head can be one of the more difficult steps in this process due to the bit going in their mouth. Hold the bit in your left had and the headpiece in your right hand in the position that it woudld sit on their head. Ease the bit into their mouth until it is behind their teeth. If they wont open their mouth you can squeeze their gums at the back of their bottom jaw to force them to open their mouth. As you put the bit in, slide the chinstrap into position underneath the chin. After the bit is in place, pull the headpiece over the horses head past the ears. When pulling the headpiece past the ears be careful with the ears by folding them forward flush aginst the horses head. Then buckle the throatlatch where the neck meets the head of the horse. Make sure to buckle with tight but not tight enough to choke the horse. Now check the browband to make sure it is in the proper position between the eyes and the ears. If the reins are not already attached to the bridle, then attach the reins to the loops at the ends of the bit where the cheekstraps and chinstrap come together.
### 5. Mounting the Horse
First you want to pull the reins over the horses head and lay them on its neck. Then untie the lead rope from whatever it was tied to. Either detach the lead rope from the halter or tie it to the front rigging dee on the saddle. There is a general rule of thumb of mounting a horse from the left side, and it is a correct rule of thumb. Stick your left foot in the leftside stirrup, then grab the saddle horn, simultaneusly push off your left foot and swing your right leg over the back of the horse. Once in the saddle make sure both feet are in the stirrups and you have the reins in your hand.
