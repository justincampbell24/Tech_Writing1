## Summary

The following instructions are to explain the process of catching, saddling, and riding a horse. The instructions will also cover how to behave around a horse as well as control it. 

## Introduction

Riding a horse is a process that is more than jumping on a horse and galloping away. Horse riding involves several different aspects that include catching the horse, cleaning the horse, saddling the horse, bridling the horse, and then finally getting on the horse and riding it. Properly following the sequence of events will keep the person riding the horse safe as well as keep the horse safe. Horses can be skittish, so it is always important that safety be kept in mind while handling a horse. 
### Tools Needed
Bridle, Saddle (breaststrap, front cinch, flank cinch, connection straps), Comb, brush, halter, lead rope, reins, a friend to help, saddle blanket

## Step by Step Instructions
### Catching the Horse
Catching the horse you are going to ride can be somewhat difficult depending on the horses attitude and personality. Having a bucket of grain is always helpful in attracting the horse close enough to catch. Once the horse comes close enough wrap the lead rope around the horses neck to give it the illusion it is caught, then put the halter on the horses head, and reattach the lead rope to the base of the halter.
